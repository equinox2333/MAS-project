### How to use this backend Flask server:
1. run main.py to initiate different functions in userAPI.py
2. create_account.py is used to create new account with user email and password. 
3. When you use a local server (Postman as an example), under the 'body' section, you can type in your input. The API will generate the result for your input, and further store it in firebase database.
